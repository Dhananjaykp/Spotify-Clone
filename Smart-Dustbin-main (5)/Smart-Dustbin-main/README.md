# Smart-Dustbin
A smart dustbin which can open and close its lid automatically as soon as someone comes near it to throw something.
The main concept behind the Smart Dustbin using Arduino project is Object Detection.

1. Ultrasonic Sensor :
   Ultrasonic sensors, as its name suggests, make use of ultrasonic waves in order to do distance measurements. The sensor head is responsible for both the transmission of an ultrasonic wave and the reception of the wave after it has been reflected back from the target. The distance to the target may be determined using ultrasonic sensors by measuring the amount of time that elapses between the signal's emission and receipt. A single ultrasonic element is used for both emission and reception in an optical sensor, but an ultrasonic sensor only has a single ultrasonic element. An optical sensor has a transmitter and a receiver . One oscillator in are reflecting type ultrasonic sensor is responsible for both the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves in alternating fashion. This makes it possible to reduce the size of the sensor head.

2.	Servo Motor :
   The term "servo" refers to a sort of error-sensing feedback control that issued in order to improve the functioning of a system. In addition to this, it calls for a controller of an advanced level, often a specialized module that was developed only for integration with servomotors. DC motors known as servo motors allow for very fine control of an object's angular position. They are essentially DC motors, and the gears bring the speed down to a  more manageable level. Servo motors typically have a rotation cutoff that ranges from 90 degrees to 180 degrees. A number of the servo motors also feature a revolution cut of that is  more than 360 degrees. Servo motors, on the other hand, do not spin continuously. Their rotation is constrained by the fixed angles that are between them.

 3. Bo Motor:
    A "BO motor" typically refers to a small DC (direct current) gear motor commonly used in hobby electronics and robotics. "BO" stands for "Battery Operated," highlighting its suitability for low-voltage, battery-powered projects. These motors are popular for their ease of use, affordability, and compatibility with various robotic components. They usually come with built-in gearboxes to provide higher torque at lower speeds, making them ideal for driving wheels or other mechanical parts in small robots or DIY projects.
